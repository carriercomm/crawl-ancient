-- look at all the XXX and FIXME comments in the code
-- Which compile time options will be made standard?  What are the the
   appropriate defaults for the config file (set in initfile.cc)?  These
   have to be laid out before the release.
-- might want to branch off a version of the source for the next release,
   with the unused spells and code cut out (along with some of the
   unimporant comments).  The full code would naturally still be used
   as the development code.
-- documentation (crawl.txt, crawl.6 will probably need some changes)
-- bow messages on skill screen might take up too much real estate
   (things are already tight for people on 24 line terminals once they
   get all the skills)
-- very noisy gcc --Wall compile (it was bad before, I'm afraid I've
   made it worse, it's hard to tell I get a lot of warnings from
   curses that have to do with some unimportant system conflicts).
-- giant spores sometimes seg fault when exploding (I added a simple check
   for NULL, but that's probably not the problem)
-- fix throwing at invisible monster code (no message when you miss, possible
   message if you hit -- it's apparently backwards right now).
-- look into why you.equip[EQ_WEAPON] (aka weapon) is used in
    fight.cc::monster_fight() and monster_attack() (ie. when the
    player isn't even involved!)
-- BUG: no "scores" file == segfault
-- 'X' (view map) causes core dumps on terminals larger than 64 lines?
