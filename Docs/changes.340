                           Version 3.40 Changelog

   Note:

     This file documents the progressive development of Crawl 3.40. Much
     of it discusses specific changes to the codebase that may prove
     uninteresting to non-programmers. The devteam has made no great
     effort to clean up our comments.

     Do you seek a more accessible overview of the latest changes? Those
     answering "yes" should read the versions.txt entry for Crawl 3.40
     instead.

06.03.2000 [Brent Ross]

-- removed strength loss from berserk penalty (acr.cc)
-- added Trog code to berserk (fight.cc, acr.cc)
-- changed Berserkers and Paladins back to their original weapons/skills
    (newgame.cc) (actually, changed Paladins to sabres... Linley's suggestion)
-- removed learning from stave combat (fight.cc)
-- made vorpal weapons less common, other egos more common? (dungeon.cc)
-- changes to makefile.sol
-- upped armour penalty to spells, reduced armour skill reduction (spells0.cc)
-- armour changes (player.cc, spells0.cc)
    - elven armour is better for spells, dwarven for AC from skill for everyone
-- paralysis leaves you easier to hit (player.cc)
-- reduced Xom's prayer reponse rate (religion.cc)

-- penance and gift timeouts for gods (files.cc, extern.h, religion.cc, newgame.cc, ability.cc)
    - divine_retribution() (religion.cc, decks.cc, spells.cc)
    - added god_speaks() so that the other gods can use colourful text

-- indented code
-- improved the demonspawn AC mutations (by boosting the number of
    levels for the lower ones)
-- extended spellbooks to max 8 spells... restored levitation to air,
   removed "Summon Elemental" from Ice (their "elemental" is really the
   Ice Beast, they get no benefit summoning Water Elementals).

-- added Confusing Touch as a first level spell for enchanters, and
   Sure Blade as a second level spell... removed wand and gave them
   some enchanted darts.


23.02.2000 [Don Brodale]

  Borrowed Fixes:
     * implemented Linley-suggested bugfix in misc.cc:down_stairs() to
       fix "Abyss bug" that was actually a/the "Pandemonium bug"
     * copied over new makefile.sol that bwross posted to onelist.com

  Gameplay Changes:
     * stalkers, assassins, and venom mages now begin the game with
       knowlege of Poison Potions (c.f., Paladins and Healers possessing
       knowledge of Healing Potions)

  Structural Alterations:
     * externs.h now #includes enum.h -- already de facto standard, now
       openly the case
     * moved files not directly related to current build into subfolder
       labeled "misc"
     * moved files not integrated into current build into the subfolder
       labeled "unused"
     * rumours.cc removed from makefile.obj and moved to "unused" folder
     * proper #includes for decks.cc now in place -- dot_h.h was only
       used here, now moved to the "unused" folder
     * redundant #include defines.h in invent.cc and mstruct.cc removed,
       as they are already #include'd in externs.h
     * changed some things like: "menv[bk].type = MONS_ABOMINATION_SMALL
       + (random2(2)) * 26;" to a conditional if-else on coinflip() --
       avoids mixing enums with math and probably executes more quickly,
       too
     * flipped a lot of conditional clauses to place function calls last
       in && and || chains to take advantage of short-circuit logic,
       saving routines from possibly needless function calls

  New Functions:
     * stuff::coin_flip() to replace random2() when desired result is
       only true or false -- does not use rand() or random() for value
       returned, so gets around "iffy" rand() implementations on low
       order bits (from *Numerical Recipies in C*)
     * stuff::one_chance_in() added to help clean up conditional elements
       like ".. && random2(foo) == 0 .." -- !one_chance_in() more
       intuitive than !random2(), too
     * stuff::stepdown_value() added to replace [and generalize] repeated
       conditional chains in spells2.cc -- see stuff.cc for details
     * stuff::table_lookup() added to randomly return a value from an
       unbounded list of possible values and probabilities
     * food::is_carnivore() added to handle set conditional evaluation in
       food.cc and itemuse.cc -- plan on expanding at some later date

  Changes to Existing Functions:
     * item_name::initial() -> item_name::clear_ids() to clarify at a
       glance what this function does
     * extended random22() to accept any number of 'dice' for averaging,
       renamed to random2avg()
     * extended random40() to accept any limit, renamed random2limit()
     * "fixed" item_use::drink_fountain()
     * "fixed" spells2::cast_twisted() a bit -- needs more fixing
     * typo in dungeon.cc limited weapon given to elven mage-types to
       whips and sabres *only* (fixed)
     * nested [in place of stacked] strings of conditional statements in
       player::you_resist_magic(), beam::check_monster_magres(),
       skills2::clac_ep() to eliminate needless value checking
     * changed create_monster() call in spells2::summon_butter() to
       duration 22 [from 21] to match other summoning spells
     * altered staff description routine in describe.cc to prepend "This
       staff"
     * dungeon::box_room() optimized for efficiency -- lopsided odds for
       placement of one (and only one) additional door reflects original
       algorithm [I cannot explain why it should be this way]
     * dungeon::city_level() clarified and optimized
     * dungeon::place_shops() optimized a bit
     * dungeon::plan_4() optimized a bit -- removed variable boxy_type,
       as it was useless
     * dungeon::prepare_swamp() optimized slightly
     * dungeon::generate_abyss() logic clarified
     * it_use2::zappy() -- changed func_pass[5] for ZAP_ICE_STORM to
       BEAM_ICE (23) from BEAM_COLD (3) in accordance with comment and
       spell description
     * shopping::shop_getch() removed entirely and replaced by
       stuff:get_ch() -- differed only in that the former returned char
       and the latter unsigned char [variable ft in shopping::in_a_shop()
       changed to unsigned char as a result]
     * spell::surge_power() -- replaced successive if-tests with complex
       conditional to limit tests performed to carry out its task
     * spells2::summon_elemental() would create sleeping elementals if
       they were summoned hostile to spellcaster (fixed)
     * spells2::summon_swarm() cleaned-up to make creature selection
       clearer; added giant mosquito; red wasp -> wolf spider
       [reversion]; killer bee larvae -> scorpion [as commented];
     * spells2::summon_things() -- apparent reversal of
       MONS_ABOMINATION_SMALL and MONS_ABOMINATION_LARGE [jdf flagged it
       first] fixed by correcting improper enumeration (see below)
     * spells2::summon_undead() cleaned-up by replacing successive
       conditional calls to rand2() with one switch call to rand2() per
       loop-through -- if odds look funny, it represents evaluation of
       original coding
     * removed double assignment of numsc from spells2.cc:summon_swarm()
       and spells2.cc:summon_undead()
     * newgame::class_allowed() cases now uniformly list >disallowed<
       species for all classes [except hunter]
     * newgame.cc:init_player() -- eliminated redundant you.level_type
       initialization, general clean-up
     * recoded describe::describe_potion() and describe::describe_food()
       to handle redundant wordings -- more cases involved, but fewer
       textual chunks
     * dungeon::place_specific_trap() now returns bool instead of int
     * fight::jelly_divide() now returns bool instead of int
     * invent::invent() is now takes bool instead of char for second
       parameter
     * item_use::drink_fountain() now returns bool instead of char
     * misc::go_berserk() now returns bool instead of char
     * monstuff::random_near_space() now returns bool instead of char
     * overmap::print_level_name() now returns bool and takes bool as
       third parameter, which also means that already_printed is now type
       bool, too
     * player::player_see_invis() now returns unsigned char instead of
       int
     * player::wearing_amulet() now returns bool instead of char
     * spells::learn_a_spell() now returns bool instead of char
     * spells::which_spellbook() now returns bool instead of int
     * spells0::spell_type() now returns bool instead of int
     * spells2::brand_weapon() now returns bool instead of char
     * spells3::you_teleport2() now takes bool instead of char
     * stuff::see_grd() now returns bool instead of char

  Changes to Variables:
     * nulled out Great Swords array entries in skills2.cc -- no longer
       used in Crawl
     * uncommented the last four entries to the skills[][] array and
       deleted the fourth -- entries now match size of array as declared
       elsewhere
     * converted some integer constants (foo = 59) to single-quoted
       characters (foo = ';') where appropriate
     * int item_sacr in religion::altar_prayer() deleted, as it was
       unusued

  Changes to In-Game Messages and Textual Elements:
     * VERSION set to "3.40pr" so people know this is not the final
       release
     * BUILD_DATE set to "23 Feb 2000" -- I think we should use month
       abbreviation to avoid numerical confusion
     * minor tweaking of messages relating to undead players
     * special statue transformation message for gnomes added
     * grammatical clean-up and rewording of all spell descriptions in
       describe.cc -- all checked, some changed a little
     * item descriptions added to itemname.cc for BOOK_PARTY_TRICKS and
       BOOK_CANTRIPS (jmf/bcr forgot to do so?)
     * "book of Useful Magic" -> "book of Practical Magic"
     * "book of Poisonings" -> "Young Poisoner's Handbook" (it's a movie
       reference)
     * "book of Envenomations" -> "book of Toxins"
     * "book of Storms and Fire" -> "book of the Tempests"
     * "Anita" ->"Snorg" within its m_list.h entry
     * "Sneaker" -> "Sneak" for stealthy types (otherwise, does one
       become an old tennis shoe?)
     * "Assassin" -> "Blackguard" for stabbing to avoid confusion with
       character class
     * "Thief" -> "Covert" for stealthy types to avoid confusion with
       character class (in case class ever displayed in the future)
     * "Axe Maniac" -> "Halberdier" for polearms -- category includes
       more than axes, so this is a better fit and avoids repetition of
       another "top level" skill name
     * "Bombardier" -> "Flinger" for slings, as it is more descriptive of
       a slinger's actions
     * "Crazy Person" -> "Whirler" and "Really Crazy Person" -> "Crazy
       Person" for slings -- the joke still remains, but some dignity is
       restored to slingers everywhere
     * "Igniter" -> "Firebug" and "Burner" -> "Arsonist" for Fire Magic

  Enumerations and Defines:
     * COLORS #define applied to numerical values still present in
       m_list.h
     * applied COLOR #defines to it_use2::zappy() for ZAPs not switched
       over from value numbers
     * applied COLOR #defines to remaining codebase, where I could find
       references still using numerical values -- I think I overdid it a
       bit and need to go back and fix a particular set of replacements
       (my secret)
     * #define NO_MUT (in mutations.cc) replaced by last member in
       MUTATIONS: NUM_MUTATIONS
     * #define NO_EQUIP replaced by last member in EQUIPMENT enum:
       NUM_EQUIP
     * removed #defines (and references to them) for Tome of Destruction
       and Manuals in dungeon.cc -- superceded by BOOKS
     * replaced 501 with ING where appropriate -- only scattered
       instances of bare 501's left in the source code
     * MLAVAfoo and MWATERbar #defines restricted to use only in certain
       header files [m_list.h monsstat.h newmonst.h], with the exception
       of MLAVA4 used in monstuff.cc (what is it?) -- I'll clean these up
       later, but other than this, they are no longer used in the
       remainder of the codebase
     * CLOUD_ENERGY -> CLOUD_PURP_SMOKE -- that is what it is, after all
     * CLOUD_STICKY_FLAME -> CLOUD_BLACK_SMOKE -- that is what it is,
       after all
     * MONS_SMALL_ABOMINATION -> MONS_ABOMINATION_LARGE and
       MONS_LARGE_ABOMINATION -> MONS_ABOMINATION_SMALL -- mistakenly
       reversed in enum sometime before
     * MONS_ANITA -> MONS_SNORG -- regenerates and described as being a
       hairy troll, so must be Snorg!
     * MONS_FAKE_RAKSHASA -> MONS_RAKSHASA_FAKE
     * MONS_SMALL_ZOMBIE -> MONS_ZOMBIE_SMALL
     * MONS_BIG_ZOMBIE -> MONS_ZOMBIE_LARGE
     * MS_SUMMON_LESSER_DEMON -> MS_SUMMON_DEMON_LESSER -- I like
       hierarchies
     * MS_SUMMON_DEMON_1 -> MS_SUMMON_DEMON_GREATER -- _1 too similar to
       _I = potential typos
     * MS_GERYON -> MS_SUMMON_BEAST -- more descriptive of its actual
       function
     * MS_SLOW_DUP -> MS_CONFUSE -- that is what it is according to
       monstuff.cc:handle_wand() - removed deprecate comment from enum.h
     * NWPN_VAMPIRE_S_TOOTH -> NWPN_VAMPIRES_TOOTH -- just too awkward as
       it was
     * added BURDEN_STATES -- applied to you.burden_state
     * added DEMON_CLASS -- applied throughout
     * added HUNGER_STATES -- applied to you.hunger_state
     * added SPELLBOOK_CONTENTS -- applied throughout
     * added UNDEAD_STATES -- applied to you.is_undead
     * added SHOPS -- applied to env.sh_type[]
     * expanded CLOUD_TYPES: _SMOKEs, _MIASMA, _DEBUGGING, and most _MONS
       variations
     * expanded DUNGEON FEATURES to include elements 208,209,210 (Dry
       Fountains VII and VIII and the PermaDry(tm) Fountain,
       respectively)
     * expanded OBJECT_CLASSES to include OBJ_GEMSTONES
     * expanded SYMBOLS to include SYM_DEBUG
     * expanded ZAPS to include added ZAP_ISKS_CROSS -- current use
       commented out in zappy()
     * mass enum'ing all over the codebase -- you name it, I tried to
       enumerate it


10.01.2000 [Brian Robinson]

     * From Josh Fishman:
          + lots of enumming, mostly spells;
          + Paladins get a long sword and long sword skill to start;
          + Spriggans may now be stalkers;
          + poisoning something already poisoned gives extra naughty;
          + more powerful staves added;
          + armour skill no longer affects penalty to spellcasting for
            wearing armor;
          + summon small mammals spell improved; and
          + Vehumet will protect against spell failures and preserve
            intelligence.
     * large characters receive a smaller spellcasting penalty for
       bearing large shields;
     * easy crawl bug in wizard mode fixed;
     * wiz commands for controlled blink and create up staircase added;
     * wiz help fixed so that all wiz commands now have help;
     * subspecies selection in newgame.cc changed to prevent duplication
       of information -- see the newgame.cc for details;
     * Ogre berserkers now start with Club skill level 3 and Maces skill
       level 1 -- the reverse of all other races, because they begin with
       clubs rather than axes;
     * Troll berserkers start with Unarmed skill level 3 and Dodging
       skill level 2, but no weapon skills -- because they start without
       weapons;
     * Halflings may now be assassins and warpers; and
     * Thieves start with more gold: random2(10) * 6 + random2(10) * 4.


30.12.1999 [Brian Robinson]

     * linuxlib.* axed
     * versions.txt updated to reflect new release
     * version and build date #defines in version.h updated
     * a little more explanatory info added to init.txt
     * some completed tasks eliminated from todo.txt and bugs.txt
     * disclaimer added to this file


27.12.1999 [Linley Henzell]

     * USE_NEW_RANDOM tuned to reasonable pace when an FP coprocessor is
       absent
     * many minor tweaks


09.12.1999 [Linley Henzell]

     * new berserk code works with ctrl+direction attacks
     * savefiles deleted after death (under DOS, at least)
     * xp no longer awarded for killing creatures created friendly
     * a few new low-level monsters
     * new init.txt options:
          + colour-code play-screen map, like the 'X' map
          + remove monsters and clouds from map
     * horned characters can wear caps and hats
     * class names switched back into lower case (where appropriate)
     * informed when a monster's enchantments wear off (if in view)
     * more information provided when looking at a monster
     * monsters no longer cast animate dead when corpses aren't in sight
     * most abilities can be used while hungry (not starving)
     * monster invisibility can now wear off (it couldn't before)
     * deflect/repel missiles enchantments now affect missile traps
     * dexterity affects shield use
     * monster AI improvements:
          + strong monsters only pick up missiles if already carrying
            some
          + some improvements made to monster path-finding
     * USE_NEW_RANDOM rand() removed -- randart code relies on random()
     * ghosts deal 2/3 as much damage; xp value reduced


18.11.1999 [Daniel Ligon]

     * shop prices right-justified
     * yellow Xom patch fixed
     * Xom will sometimes answer prayers
     * evasion strengthened
     * killed-by list enumerated; added "killed by an exploding spore"
     * many calls to 'random() % x' replaced with 'random2(x)'
     * calls to random3() and random4() eliminated
     * Makhleb's minor destruction toned down
     * amulets placed in the discovery listing
     * beginning spells fixed for kobold summoners
     * invisible undead referred to as "it"
     * Spriggan assassins permitted -- speed/low food requirements
       (Spriggan) greatly complement hand crossbow (assassin)


15.10.1999 [Brian Robinson]

     * can acquire() food: royal jellies given to non-ghouls; royal
       jellies or chunks to ghouls (attempted a variety of foods; proved
       too big a pain)
     * '#define XOM_ACTS_YELLOW' added to AppHdr.h
     * acr.cc:srand() added for USE_NEW_RANDOM to work properly


14.10.1999 [Brian Robinson]

     * fixed: problem where some super-long strings in describe.cc got
       cut up, causing a compiler error (where possible, please try to
       keep lines < 80 characters)
     * describe_god() enumerated in describe.cc
     * makefile.sgi option added to Makefile (doesn't work)
     * fixed bugs culled from bugs.txt
     * EasyCrawl(tm) door opening: walking into door opens it, running
       into door opens the door and stops player
     * GOD_NO_GOD case added to describe.cc:describe_religion() (it was
       an acr.cc special case, but that's gone now)
     * '#include <stdio.h>' added to fight.cc and spells2.cc because both
       call sprintf() (would compile/link properly without it under Linux
       but not DOS)
     * makefiles .dos, .emx, and .sol tweaked


12.10.1999 [Brian Robinson]

     * version string changed to "3.40" and '#define BUILD_DATE' added to
       version.h for output alongside version number
     * '#define USE_NEW_RANDOM' added to AppHdr.h
     * duplicate/completed items removed from todo.txt (may have missed
       some -- only cut those marked "done")
     * inspect item command (in shops) changed to 'v'
     * contents of oldmakefiles directory archived as oldmake.zip
     * make distclean now deletes *.sav, *.lab, core, and *.0* (DOS and
       Linux)
     * fixed: some class names in newgame.cc were not capitalized
     * new random number generator added -- should be a little better
       than old RNG; uses rand() rather than random() to generate number
       (#define USE_NEW_RANDOM to enable)
     * wizmode fixes:
          + some creatures (e.g., necrophage) reduce max_hp (NAB:
            reduction to zero normally means death) -- in wizmode,
            negative max_hp results, triggering "you died, but its okay"
            message every turn; added "you.max_hp = abs(you.max_hp)" to
            the 'h' wizard command to correct negative max_hp
          + stethoscope unmapped from 's' key -- terribly annoying for
            me, since I can't rest with '5' under Linux (can still
            stethoscope by targetting or looking)
          + WIZARD compiled binaries append "Wiz" to any scores they
            generate
          + help screen added, accessed by keying in '&' then '?' (lists
            wizard commands in a fashion similar to normal help screen)
          + bugfix: Daniel's command code blocked wizard command
     * Daniel's patches:
          + '#define XOM_ACTS_YELLOW' to render Xom's messages in yellow
          + bugfix: Abyss crash bug
          + new wizmode commands: "banish" and "Xom acts"
     * 'v' and 'V' commands swapped -- examining an item seemed more
       likely (to me) than version check, so "examine" now lowercased
     * wizard option added to Makefile (same as debug but includes
       -DWIZARD)
     * weapons of reaching used to attack one monster behind another may
       instead hit the monster inbetween
     * giant races penalized less for using large shields; normal-sized
       monsters may be penalized slightly more, but only by one or so
     * debug.cc:error_message_to_player() added to output:
       "You have encountered a program bug.
       Please exit the level and save."
       (previous instances of this message replaced with calls to this
       function)
     * haste and slow counters in acr.cc changed to take into account
       amulet of resist slow: haste subtracts random2(2) each turn
       (rather than one -- which could have led to infinite haste, but
       let's not worry about that) and slow subtracts five (one
       previously) each turn


02.10.1999 [Brian Robinson]

     * help screen reformatted to spot entries more readily (at a
       glance); added "more" capability so that [command summaries >
       screen size] prompt user for more, preventing screen overflow
     * amulet of maintain speed changed to the amulet of resist slowness:
       old item description mentioned both resist slow and a speed bonus,
       but the code only implemented resist slow -- wearing the amulet
       now grants +10 to any hasting and also to maximum possible hasting
     * some silly messages involving hasting and slowing changed
     * messages indicating spell-casting failure added to the raise dead
       functions, but I'm not sure they work (coding very confused here;
       may only work some of the time)
     * '#ifdef LINUX'-ed the acr.cc code [lines 663 - 676] which uses
       variables declared in another '#ifdef LINUX' block (something may
       be screwed up because I'm not sure what's going on here)


29.09.1999 [Brian Robinson]

     * highscore() fixed so that it doesn't take so long
     * scores output padded with some whitespace to improve appearance
     * bugfix for 'a' being in scores (see bugs.txt and ouch.cc)
     * comments added to enum.h showing where unique monsters are
     * first argument removed from view.cc:draw_border() (same value
       always passed)
     * bugfix: player's score not always saved
     * some problems with the new makefiles noticed while compiling under
       DOS: any platform with its own library (e.g., liblinux) should be
       +='ed to OBJECTS in appropriate system-specific makefile
     * Makefile: noopt (no optimization) added to allow me to compile
       under DOS without headaches


28.09.1999 [Daniel Ligon]

     * linuxlib.* renamed to liblinux.*
     * keypad for ncurses (Linux port) enabled
     * liblinux.cc:kbhit() will always return 0
     * big lookup table added to liblinux.cc to convert keypresses into
       commands
     * enumerated commands added to both enum.h and big switch statement
       in acr.cc
     * Brian's makefiles added


24.09.1999 [Brent Ross]

     * bugfix for evasion
     * macro.cc:getch_mul() reverted
     * red devils have probablistic chance for (trident|demon trident|no
       weapon)
     * demon tridents correctly coloured
     * xp spending cap/MAX_SPENDING_LIMIT
     * broad axe, spiked flail, and great flail less common
     * floating point operations in update_corpses() reduced
     * all demonspawn scales/plates can be given at one or two levels
     * max_hp ceiling displayed when player's max_hp reduced
     * from Linley:
          + portal fixed so that it doesn't go below level 27
          + fixed checks for translocating in the Abyss
          + added fix for going to Pandemonium or the Abyss from Hell
          + note about using '+' for targeting added to various prompts
          + ghosts fade away only if they have fewer than half their hp


12.09.1999 [Linley Henzell]

     * "Over-map" added
     * messages can be coloured -- just call set_colour() before mpr()
     * wild magic effects do more harm; increased likelihood of higher
       levels of effect
     * blink may not work and teleport takes longer in the Abyss
     * a few unrandarts tweaked
     * rewrote part of dungeon.cc weapon generation function; added
       weapon rarity function
     * some monsters receive a wider range of weapons
     * many high-powered demons have greater speeds
     * several changes to skills.cc; having many xp in the pool increases
       the cost of exercising
     * threshold values increased for special "you hit" messages and some
       grammar patched -- see fight.cc
     * three 'silly' monsters removed: dorgi, sword, and guardian robot
     * haste has a direct effect on time_taken, rather than being treated
       separately -- see player_speed()
     * boots of levitation allow permanent hovering
     * random events in Hell are much nastier
     * clouds can be overwritten by other clouds, sometimes -- see
       place_cloud()
     * monster mutation spell affects monsters as polymorph
     * new init.txt variable [verbose] determines level of detail about
       randarts and other magical items in character dump
     * monsters can cast 'direct' spells (e.g., smiting) over other
       monsters if targeting player
     * giants given the correct number of rocks


09.09.1999 [Brent Ross]

     * damage lowered for some new weapons; tridents made heavier
     * some changes from Dustin Ragan added to the newgame screens
     * spellcasting reduced by weapon size [weight and/or speed]
     * from Linley:
          + verified helmet/helm colour initialisation to LIGHTCYAN
          + swapping item letters outputs both items affected
          + '=' fixed to '==' in randart.cc line 1515
          + bugfix: more scrolling problem under DOS
          + bugfix: problem with the ctrl-direction keys under DOS
          + subspecies selection made into compile time option
          + horns mutation removed as a possibility for minotaurs
     * Great Swords skill removed -- great swords/triple swords treated
       as long swords
     * Trolls + troll leather changed to no effect
     * gdbm stuff removed -- makes things simpler; better security can
       wait for new savefile implementation
     * hand-and-a-half weapons:
          + no bonus if weapon is cursed
          + 1-1/2 hand weapons don't get the speed bonus past 10
          + two-handed weapons can get as fast as speed 7 with skill
          + +random2(3) to hit
          + +random2(3) to dam [all two-handed weapons] applied after
            skill multipliers (i.e., with the dwarf and orc modifiers)
     * multiple shield blocks in a turn becomes increasingly difficult
     * fighters get dodging or armour skills on basis of starting armour
     * shields and large shields slow down attacks


27.08.1999 [Brent Ross]

     * character dump includes '*' for level 27 skills
     * removing the "skill_change /= 2" line from spell skills was a bit
       hard on early spellcasters (it seems reasonable to give to
       low-level characters and phase out by mid-game, when it isn't
       needed)
     * bugfix: "Crush" required conjurations (hold over from Throw
       Pebble)
     * bugfix: having 1 xp in the pool permitted a lot of free practising
     * penalty increased for heavy armour, now more in line with the new
       shield penalty (are these values high enough?)
     * Linley's new weapon suggestions added: axe, spiked flail, great
       mace, great flail
     * damage increased for some maces and flails (swords are quick and
       accurate, maces and flails hit harder)
     * "Boots" changed to "Barding" in centaur/naga equipment lists
     * crystal plate mail somewhat resistant to corrosion
     * +/- markers added to skills screen for benefit of monochrome
       displays
     * bugfix: labyrinth problems
     * bugfix: LOS corner problem
     * bugfix: can now make with -DWIZARD
     * spellcasting/invocation interference removed
     * weapon additions: broad axe [rare, 15, +3, 17], trident [9, -2,
       16], and demon trident [evil -- wielded by red devils: 15, -2, 16]
     * polearms/whips of reaching added
     * gladiators given choice of starting with trident
     * '#define USE_NEW_BERSERK' removed
     * bugfix: incorrect display of barding AC value
     * quite a bit of cleanup (converting ints to enums in the old code)
     * draconian AC gains clean-up; removed level four increase and gave
       two AC at start
     * knife added; guaranteed on the first three levels
     * bugfix: memorizing spells was impossible on some terminals


08.08.1999 [Brent Ross]

     * bugfix: Orange Brains could hang game (MS_SUMMON_LEVEL spell in
       Abyss)
     * bugfix: monsters should no longer occur "under" the player
     * bugfix: portals weren't closed on way out, but hell gates were
       removed (now all are closed)
     * bugfix: cannot unlearn spells outside the array bounds
     * bugfix: manuals should auto-identify on the first read
     * bugfix: Healing book was available from acquirement/Sif Muna
     * missile launchers no longer train/use associated skill when used
       as melee weapons (bows/xbows will train/use maces/flails, slings
       use no skill)
     * Zot traps will no longer message their effects on monsters unless
       monster within LOS
     * bugfix: liquid flame could wrap around and last a long time
     * bugfix: whatever caused "program bugs" to occur in the Abyss
     * bugfix: number of cards in Decks of Power defaulted to 0 and thus
       gave 255 cards
     * Nemelex fixed to give cards instead of Bone Lanterns and Geryon
       Horns
     * bugfix: food was not updating with cards
     * bugfix: quick blades were getting free actions
     * spell points update when Invocations gained
     * granularity of skill gain upped to reduce "stage three":
          + number of learns from manuals upped to accommodate
          + monster xp values reduced to limit "stage two" effect
     * power of smiting again reduced (seems reasonable now)
     * teleport control restrictions (some areas will not allow
       controlled teleport)
     * runes may be stacked
     * invocations and spellcasting learning interfere with one another
       (like elemental magic)
     * increased rate of skill cost per level
     * removed division by two for cost of spellcasting skills
     * greater rarity for unique artefacts (all seem to enter quickly
       into any game, except the Sword of Power, for which the 50% chance
       against creation probably kept it out of my last game for a while)
     * evasion/shields were too good:
          + shield blocking difficulty raised a bit (from base 10 to 15)
          + player's evasion rolled in the monster to-hit check (so that
            a player with an EV of 30+ can still be hit)... added a 1/15
            chance of hitting regardless (players already got this
            advantage).
     * *.h guards moved to after the headers (cosmetic)


30.07.1999 [Brent Ross]

     * bugfix: visiting Abyss from Hall of Blades resulted in an Abyss
       populated by blades
     * bugfix: problems with highscore entries running off end of the
       line
     * electrical and poison resistances no longer absolute -- 1/3 damage
       taken on successful resist (still no poisoning for those with
       poison resistance)
     * storm dragon breath can be resisted
     * draining will drain available xp pool, too
     * spell levels moved to a function to prevent amassing a large
       number of negative spells (forgot spell that didn't exist)
     * spellcasting more difficult to get
     * bugfix: plants stalking stairs
     * dragon armours reverted to original values -- resistances and
       benefits given are good enough (basic heavy armours were the ones
       in real need of improvement)
     * bugfix: distortion weapons (from Jesse)
     * bugfix: deflect missiles status wasn't listed on '@'
     * slime pit runes are only "possible" runes -- unlikely to get four
       of them now
     * stats added to "elf" dummy monster to allow elf zombies to live
     * added redraw after projected noise
     * bugfix: objects (runes, orb) were clobbered by items given to
       monsters.
     * monster descriptions with huge gaps in them were fixed
     * bugfix: shapeshifters shouldn't polymorph into dancing blades
       (numbers for names)
     * acquirement() better than before for jewelry
     * skills screen can handle more than 26 skills
     * levels of poisoning shown for '@'
     * traps more difficult to disarm as dungeon level increases
     * traps might trigger during attempts to disarm
     * all traps handled by handle_traps()
     * are the new traps too hard on monsters? (probably yes, so they
       take old damage amounts for now)
     * player_light_armour() added, which returns true if the player is
       in light or no armour
     * bugfix: non-flying monsters were flying over traps
     * polymorphed monsters not much of an easy xp trick anymore
     * xp calculation takes into account a monster's speed
     * plant learning capped (no more than first two levels of fighting
       skills)
     * some support added for explosions destroying potions/food on
       ground are only the correct things being destroyed? -- check
       bang.cc and destroy_item()
     * wearing heavy armour provides a minium percentage of damage
       reduction:
          + percent = (skill + base AC of body armour)
          + still needs application to monsters, but monsters don't
            convieniently know whether they possess hard armour (let
            alone armour skill) so this can probably wait
     * extra protection from shrapnel attacks provided by heavy armour
       only


13.07.1999 [Brent Ross]

     * entrance to the Labyrinth blocked until debugged
     * wizmode code in acr.cc fixed; changed some commands to more easily
       remembered letters; added an identify
     * fixed some cases where cursed jewelry plusses are assumed to be
       based off 100 (creation code and many other cases suggest that
       it's 150)
     * random weapons, armour, and jewelry from acquirement() are now
       uncursed
     * demonspawn horns smoothed out so it's possible to get two levels
     * ranger changed to hunter
     * some gmon_use values changed (from Linley)
     * life protection descriptions changed
     * hunger_inc and ATTR_LIGHTNING_RESIST moved to functions in
       player() -- the attribute is now replaced with
       ATTR_DIVINE_LIGHTNING_PROTECTION (used to denote Makleb or Xom
       protecting player from a lightning attack)
     * checks added for the curses keypad enums
     * learning curve for throwing skill lowered
     * hand crossbows reduced in power
     * learning curve for traps and doors skill lowered
     * played with spellcasting staff identification
     * player ghosts fixed:
          + monsters regenerate hp while player is off level
          + ghosts regenerate and teleport away when player leaves the
            level
     * assassins changed from ninja to hand crossbow types; given
       enchanted dagger as well to help hand-to-hand
     * throwing exercise added to darts, hand axes, daggers, and spears;
       throwing skill bonus added for them, as well -- see item_use.cc
     * scythes, halberds, and glaives given a chance to be weapons of
       speed


07.07.1999 [Brent Ross]

     * breath from ice-breathing dragons won't destroy walls
     * life protection now a (level/3) chance
     * bugfix: the 120/150 hp ghost thing
     * anticheat code and security db added for multiuser systems
       (requires gdbm)
     * only picking up items has associated delay with autopickup,
       walking over uninteresting stacks shouldn't cost any extra time
     * berserk players fail the check_awaken() test with monsters and do
       not spend experience on stealth
     * dexterity added to stealth
     * ogre magi given short swords instead of daggers
     * stabbing stun effect toned down
     * stabbing dex bonus toned down -- now limited by stabbing
     * assassins start with a dagger; thieves start with short sword and
       dagger
     * stat mods reversed for thief and assassin; assassins given unarmed
       combat
     * wizard stat mods changed to +7 int/+3 dex, making them smarter
       than other spellcasters
     * draconian rangers no longer start with leather armour
     * stealth toned down a bit (and again) in player.cc:check_stealth()
     * to-hit reduced for throw fire/frost and sting -- see
       it_use2.cc:zappy()
     * bugfix: repel/deflect missiles problem -- changed bad REPEL
       reference in acr.cc
     * message added to unwielding vampiric weapons
     * new keypad support hacked up for Unix
     * shots used up 1 in 3 times
     * bonus for crossbows' to hit and dam (item_use.cc)
     * magic resistance for elves (player.cc)
     * autopickup delay upped to 3 (one and two seem to be no delay at
       all)
     * opposing elemental staves can be identified (items.cc, spell.cc)
     * zipfile removal added to ouch.cc to prevent cheating
     * bugfix: view.cc STABBING check should be STEALTH for the no-yell
       check; lowered to a straight percentage check
     * Dwarven/Orc rangers given Dodging 1 (they were a bit short on
       skills)
     * HOrs get orcish bolts (newgame.cc) -- added MISSILES check in
       HILL_ORC check
     * gladiator/fighter modifications: (newgame.cc)
          + fighters: skills -- fighting 3, weapon 2, dodging/armour 2,
            shields 2, stabbing/stealth 1, throwing 2; stats -- str +7,
            dex +3
          + kobold/troll/ogre fighters: same as before
          + gladiators: skills -- fighting 3, weapon 3, dodging/armour 2,
            shields 1, unarmed combat 2; stats -- str +6, dex +4
          + comparision to previous values:
               o fighters: lost unarmed combat; +1 shields and +1
                 throwing
               o gladiators: -1 dodging/armour and -1 shield; +2 unarmed
                 combat
               o stat bonuses swapped
               o armor for gladiator/fighter switched


22.06.1999 [Brent Ross]

     * new ranger weapon variations (halfling slingers, dwarven
       crossbowers)
     * Ranger/Reaver problem fixed -- 'R'angers are now 'r'angers (so
       capital letter R used only once)
     * stealth improvements:
          + monsters don't yell (2 * skill) % of the time -- see
            view.cc:monster_grid()
          + large races lose *2 modifier, small races receive *5/2 -- see
            player.cc:check_stealth()
               o Huge (x1): Troll, Ogre, Ogre Mage, Centaur
               o Awkward (x3/2): Minotaur, Draconians
               o Normal (x2): Everyone else
               o Small (x5/2): Halfling, Gnome, Kobold, Spriggan, Naga
                 (Naga's aren't small, but they're good)
          + BEH_CHASING_I set for sleeping monsters who are stabbed
          + now a (skill + dex)% chance of stabbing fleeing or confused
            monsters -- see fight.cc
          + backstab effectiveness depends on the monsters behaviour:
               o sleeping monsters are easy targets -- lots of damage
                 potential
               o fleeing and confused monsters -- not as much damage
                 potential
               o other cases have even less damage potential
          + backstabbing more effective for daggers: daggers add dex/3
            damage before the multipliers -- see fight.cc
     * fight.cc:monster_dies() modified so that *any* summoned creature
       killed by player/pet won't call done_good()
          + Elivion/TSO/Zin have to be passed through (not a problem
            because they can't abuse summoning, anyway)
          + this could use a better fix (i.e., tracking who summoned
            which monsters would help a lot)
     * (Linley's suggestion) monster polymorph fixed to avoid NO_EXP
       monsters: added "mons_flag(targetc, M_NO_EXP_GAIN)" to do-while
       loop
     * (Jesse's suggestion) teleport control/blink spell combo removed:
       CONTROL_TELEPORT check removed from random_blink()
     * racial bonus added to worn armour in player_AC()
     * patched hunger status display bug: added food_change() and redraw
       to down_stairs


17.06.1999 [Brian Robinson]

     Note: I've tried to annotate all my changes in the code with my
     initials [BCR] so you can grep for them to find my changes.

     * some small cleanup here and there
     * new makefile written for Linux
     * changes to the make process which should spare us future
       headaches:
          + OS_TYPE variable in the makefile that is automatically made
            into a #define during make process (should make it easy to
            keep the makefiles straight on the OS)
          + moved OBJECTS variable containing the list of the *.o files
            to a file called make.obj which is included into the makefile
            (should save a little space and keep all makefiles consistent
            on object requirements)
     * defines.h indented and added a header
     * some newgame.cc oddness fixed: various system dependent name
       checks were all messed up in a bunch of nested #ifdef stuff
       (sorted it out)
     * '#define MACROS' now does something: if defined, macros.h and
       macros.cc files will be used, otherwise they won't (right now,
       Crawl will not work correctly under Linux with MACROS defined --
       see bugs.txt)


14.06.1999 [Brent Ross]

     Some changes I added from Linley:

     * bugfix for the Geryon bug
     * message added for berserkers chopping up corpses in rage
     * some incorrect enums in it_use3.cc (for Asmodeus's staff) changed
     * demonspawn xp penalty lowered to 140%
     * Elyvilon sacrifice code fixed to limit abuse
     * priest.cc and priest.h renamed to abyss.*
     * spellcasting penalties for wearing shields upped to +5/+15/+30
       from +0/+5/+15 [buckler/shield/large shield]
     * random stat increase added for Draconians


13.06.1999 [Brent Ross]

     * Spriggans fully separated from the giant races, creating a
       separate block for tiny races in the armour wearing code
     * cursed rings identify themselves as "sticky cursed" when put on
     * weapon slot updates if player eats food that is being wielded
     * bugfix: black and grey scales reversed for demonspawn (with
       regards to number of levels gained)
     * for spells1.cc, blink() and random_blink(): weapons check removed
       because scan_randarts should be only requirement
     * bugfix: teleport control now works properly on blink (dependent on
       order of includes and target compiler/system)
     * #ifndef checking added around all *.h files to avoid problems
       similar to those above
     * full spell listing line added to character dumps
     * creaky doors are [DEX + (Stealth + Traps) / 2] checks; check added
       on closing doors, as well
     * base values of heavy armour upped by 1 or 2 points
     * spells3.cc:you_teleport() was another case of only checking the
       weapon slot for a property (hopefully, I've changed all these into
       scan_randarts)
     * mutation.cc:demonspawn() had MUT_FAST twice; changed the second to
       MUT_SHOCK_RESISTANCE (as the comment claimed)
     * strength damage bonus had an ugly discrete nature to it;
       multiplied the dammod values by 6 to get a smoother version of the
       same function
     * bugfix: screen needed to be refreshed after spell slot changes
     * new equipment listing commands:
          + ')' lists current, swap a, swap b, and default 'f'ire weapons
          + ']' lists worn armour
          + '"' lists worn jewelry (NB: '=' already used elsewhere)
     * bugfix: "shoot_skill = you.skills[SK_THROWING]" in item_use.cc was
       wrong (should clearly be CROSSBOWS when using a crossbow)
     * bugfix: handle_traps in misc() used env.trap_known instead of
       trap_known (env.trap_known doesn't seem to be referenced anywhere
       else)
     * bugfix: Vehumet's gift was still not quite correct
     * magical staves detection: staves may be detected over time or
       whenever appropriate magic is cast, depending on skill levels
     * Call Imp raised to a level three spell (too powerful for level
       two)
     * a little checking code added to dungeon.cc for monster armour
       plusses
     * bugfix: more line was misplaced on the recognized item screen
     * mix of my/DML's improvements applied to the temp file purging
       system


02.06.1999 [David Loewenstern]

     * Makefile.dos added
     * define.h updated for compatibility with DJGPP
     * items.cc, monstuff.cc, mstuff2.cc, and spells.cc cleaned up
       (mostly corrected misassignments, unsigned<->signed, unused vars,
       etc.)
     * enums added to monstuff.cc, mstuff2.cc, beam.cc
     * enum.h updated as per above
     * autopickup added
     * '&' command functions only in debug mode
     * remove_ring() now uses inventory letter
     * fight.cc features more colourful "hits" (should be useful later to
       differentiate weapons)
     * bugfix: displaying top scores when no scorefile previously had
       existed


30.05.1999 [Jesse Jones]

     * highscore() will print more scores on larger windows
     * worn cloaks no longer prevents wearing or removing body armor
     * worn armor can be dropped if it's uncursed
     * armor can be worn without removing the old armor
     * missing ponderous armor message added
     * from Brent:
          + bugfix: weapon line didn't always redraw after casting Blade
            Hands
          + detect_items() uses '~' instead of '*'
          + char_dump.cc dumps failure rates
     * wear_armour() changed to allow Spriggans to wear bucklers
     * quit only pops up save changes dialog if game_has_started is true
       (Mac)
     * AppHdr.h replaces config.h
     * all *.cc files include their header immediately after the AppHdr
       file


??.05.1999 [Brent Ross]

     * GNU indent 1.91 [-bad -bli0 -i4 -npcs -npsl] applied to get the
       intended BSD indentation style into the code; sorted through some
       things indent won't fix (more cleanup needs to be done -- notably,
       vertical whitespace and breaking up big lines -- but should be
       more readable now; no more column 0 code!)
     * various changes to make code work with NUMBER_OF_LINES instead of
       25
     * compile-time option to change default view to non-ibm graphics
     * ^R redraw screen command; screen redraws added to appropriate
       places
     * query added for normal saves (^X doesn't ask)
     * ^Y works now; ^Z suspend for Unix systems
     * refresh call added to beam.cc so beams are always visible
     * various things to deal with multiuser environment:
          + compressing save files
          + permissions handling
          + global lib directory for game files
          + changes in name validation and file name structure (added
            uid)
     * adjust item letter function now swaps items (instead of failing)
     * Selective Amnesia spell description is less confusing
     * targeting more intuitive for Angband players (t/space accepts
       targets), behaves better about canceling spells (added better
       abort)
     * unarmed combat fixed to the correct amount of time
     * bugfix: hunger/noisy wield bug where effects were not removed
     * bugfix: air staffs didn't grant resist lightning, yet took it away
       (i.e., left the resist with a value of 255, quite good unless you
       put on something of resist lightning later)
     * rings/wands/scrolls and such output a message when they are
       identified by use
     * fixed several cases where wielded object changed but the screen
       didn't update
     * bugfix: a triple level of a demonspawned mutation was never
       granted
     * patched bug where the inventory is full yet the count is wrong
       (this entire thing should be cleaned up)
     * curses attributes fixed so that alternate character sets aren't
       used under Solaris (this is probably good for any *nix not on a
       IBM alternate character set box)
     * water and earth elementals fixed for same
     * stone lined the finishing room so you can't dig through?
     * some rather silly ways of clearing areas of the screen (under
       curses) removed; proper curses functions used instead (much
       faster)
     * bugfix: going up or down stairs would clear the food status
     * bugfix: incorrect substitutions of new enums (i.e., "AC +=
       SP_HIGH_ELF; /* troll */")
     * bugfix: stat increases where comment noted "/* str or dex */", but
       "str or int" given instead
     * Troll's food consumption increased to better balance the race
     * Vehumet's gift giving code fixed to actually do what is intended
     * experience pool information added to front page
     * some of the duplicated titles (traps and doors) changed
     * stairs leading out of sub-dungeons changed to '<' character, to
       reflect the key required
     * portals coloured on the level map; all portals in Pandemonium are
       intentionally the same colour
     * kobolds receive stat increase every five levels
     * bugpatch: Demonspawn sometimes don't receive their mutations
     * Armour skill a bit better: get more in combat, a little more
       frequently otherwise; EV penalty is now recovered at skill/2
     * Sword of Power reduced in power (now +20 cap, HP/13 - 3)
     * creaking doors partially depend on skills (dex + traps + stealth,
       with benefits of last two dropping after a total of 10) instead of
       simply luck; levitation isn't a sure way to avoid this now
     * wield update inserted after reading scroll of recharging
     * high score file extended to SCORE_FILE_ENTRIES items (currently,
       only the first 15 are ever displayed)
     * USE_NEW_BERSERK:
          + berserk counter decrements faster when not attacking
            (currently using triagular progression)
          + butchery is not penalized (in fact, it resets penalty
            counter); eating isn't either (no reset, though)
          + exhausted counter added to count berserk fatigue
          + hopefully this will become part of a new, better standard
            berserk
     * skills fit onto screen by wrapping the first column (if required)
     * bugfix: RAP_PREVENT_TELEPORT and the like didn't do anything
       because they checked only the weapon, instead of using
       scan_randarts (hopefully, all the cases of this are fixed now)
     * bugfix: wield-amulet-that-you're-wearing bug
     * redraw for weapon when Blade Hands expires
     * #defines:
          + CRAWL_NAME -- auto sets player's name
          + CRAWL_PIZZA -- string describing player's choice of pizza;
            greater likelihood of incidence than others
          + USE_BSTRING_H -- handles the bstring.h/string include problem
          + NUMBER_OF_RUNES_NEEDED (defaults to 3) -- allows compiled
            games to limit entrance to Zot's domain only to those with a
            certain number of runes
          + USE_CURSES -- for things specific to curses and not just
            PLAIN_TERM.
          + USE_TCHARS_IOCTL, USE_UNIX_SIGNALS, USE_SELECT_FOR_DELAY --
            to solve various *nix variant problems should people need or
            want them
          + USE_ASCII_CHARACTERS -- sets the default to non-IBM character
            set
          + SAVE_DIR_PATH -- useful for setting a global lib directory
            for save files, bones files, and the score file
          + SHARED_FILES_CHMOD_VAL -- useful with SAVE_DIR_PATH on
            multi-user systems
          + SAVE_PACKAGE_CMD, LOAD_UNPACKAGE_CMD, PACKAGE_SUFFIX -- for
            people who want to use a program to compress and bundle their
            save games when they're not playing (not pretty, but good
            enough until we invent a better save file system)
     * "(q to drink)" added to fountain description when player steps
       over one
     * Greater Healings base upped to 50
     * Demonspawn transmuters added
     * Spriggans and Halflings consume less food (-1)
     * wizard's hats and caps are randomly coloured
     * carrying capactiy less dependent upon strength; pulled
       carrying_capacity code into a single function (as it's called from
       various different places); encumberance levels represent fractions
       of carrying capacity instead of earlier constant values
     * named artefact weapons slightly rarer; Sword of Power has 1 in 2
       check


??.05.1999 [Jesse Jones]

     * bugfix: appeared to be three bugs involving extra semi-colons
     * file names can be longer than six characters and can include
       spaces
     * some debugging macros added
     * bugifx: dragon() wasn't handling fire drakes, which meant beam
       color was uninitialized.
     * getstr() only adds printable characters to the buffer (Mac)
     * mons_spells() now returns a struct instead of using an int array
       -- affects mstuff2.cc, mstuff.h, and handle_wand()
     * mons_near() now returns a bool. I've changed code like
       "mons_near(o) == 1" and "mons_near(i) != 0" to "mons_near(o)" and
       "!mons_near(i)"
     * print_description() no longer indexes past the end of the string.
     * minor changes made to the code to allow compilation with the
       "require function protypes" warning
     * UNUSED template function added to config.h
     * rewrote describe.cc and describe.h:
          + reformatted
          + string objects used in place of hard-coded char arrays
          + ten new functions split out from describe_item()
          + get_item_description() and is_random_artifact() added
     * rewrote chardump.cc
          + reformatted
          + string objects used
          + seven functions split out from dump_char
          + dumps artifact info
     * reformatted viewwindow2(); added some ASSERTs; split out
       get_ibm_symbol()
     * reformatted monster() and split out ten(!) new functions
     * reformatted mons_spells() and mons_cast(); mons_spells() case 49
       uses RED instead of (bogus) 20 for color
     * some ASSERTs added to seekmonster()
     * DEBUG renamed to WIZARD
     * DEBUG_BUILD renamed to DEBUG
     * manage_corpses() renamed to handle_time()
     * code changed to use new CORPSE_BODY and CORPSE_SKELETON enums
     * struct.h deleted
     * player::elapsed_time added (holds the total amount of elapsed time
       in the game)
     * level and game save routines tweaked to include a variable sized
       chunk of extra data
     * save level code saves a timestamp; load level code uses timestamp
       to update corpses and chunks
     * many player struct members renamed
     * all of the monsters, item_struct, and ghost_struct members renamed
     * comment blocks added to the top of all files
     * TRACE debug function added
     * you and env are no longer arrays
     * bugfix: display_char_status() displayed the wrong message if the
       player had magic contamination
     * look_around() no longer prints a prompt (so things like blink and
       open door no longer prompt "Press '?' for a monster description.")
     * show_map() accepts '\r' along with '.'
     * Cekugob no longer conveys resistances to fire and cold
     * spellbook_contents() prints unknown spells in light blue
     * show_map() draws shops in yellow
