Notes for building crawl with VACPP
-----------------------------------
* when including source,  make sure source type is
  defined to be 'cpp'  - VACPP doesn't know how to
  handle .cc extensions.
* include libw32c.cc as a source object;
  ignore the other lib*.cc files
* define the macro WIN32CONSOLE
* MUST build with signedchars = yes
* MUST build with emumsize = 4
* should probably target pentium-class machines.

Other than this,  it's pretty straightforward.


//jmf: wrt/ 'target pentium-class machines': from Linux compiles, I know
//     most of the benefit of 32-bit-happiness comes from just targeting
//     486-class machines. Compiling for a Pentium implies a bunch of
//     Pentium-specific idioms which are slower on PPro/PII(I) and don't
//     work at all on 486s.
//
//     VACPP may or may not conform to the above behavior. :-)
