Notes for building crawl with VACPP
-----------------------------------
* when including source,  make sure source type is
  defined to be 'cpp'  - VACPP doesn't know how to
  handle .cc extensions.
* include libw32c.cc as a source object;
  ignore the other lib*.cc files
* define the macro WIN32CONSOLE
* MUST build with signedchars = yes
* MUST build with emumsize = 4
* target architecture should probably be 486 machines.

  According to jmf,  targetting Pentium class machines
  implies Pentium-specific instructions which are
  actually slower on PPro/PII/PIII machines.

Other than this,  it's pretty straightforward.


Notes for building crawl with Borland C++ 5.01
----------------------------------------------
* must alter the Tool information for CppCompile to
  'understand' .cc extensions (in Advanced Tools Settings)
* include libw32c.cc as source; ignore other lib*.cc files
* define macro WIN32CONSOLE
* MUST build with "Unsigned Characters" OFF
* MUST build with "Allocate Enums as Ints" ON
* MUST set search directories so that the Crawl Source directory
  is searched before the BC5\INCLUDE directory.
* target architecture should probably be 486 machines
  (see note for VACPP)
* helps to set Warnings to "Selected Subset only" or you
  get ZILLIONS of warnings.   I usually turn off all the
  "Code Efficiency" warnings.  :)
* for best results,  specify following in target expert:
  - Win32 Console Application (.exe)
  - _Everything_ unchecked
  - Static linking
