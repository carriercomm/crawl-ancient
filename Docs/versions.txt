Log of Changes:
The name after each bug is the person who found it and told me first. If you
find a bug and for some reason don't want to be credited, just tell me on the
bug report.

1.0 (2/10/97)
first (rather buggy) version

1.01 (3/10/97)
Shields were changed
Items were made more common
monsters were made less common (this was a bug)
cursed weapons were made less common (this was just bad planning)
I changed the name to make it a bit less egotistical
Bugs removed include:
 a debugging feature of the 'x' command was unintentionally left in;
 the summon scorpions spell summoned a vampire (oops) (Haran Pilpel);
 sometimes +50 armour could be generated (oops again) (Haran Pilpel);
 the inventory item counter was not decremented when you dropped something!
  This would lead to you being unable to pick things up after a while (Darren
  Hebden);
 a bug with detect curse scrolls (Darren Hebden)
 slime creatures and jellies were a bit weak;
 killing normal (not spitting) plants gave you far too much xp;
 your rate of regeneration was not saved properly;
 about half of the rings could never be generated;
 the 's' command would sometimes make you repeat your last move (Haran
  Pilpel);
 I forgot to mention the walk-in-place function in any documentation;
 I set the level builder to put 100 monsters on each new level for
  debugging, and forgot to reset it - I really should playtest more!;
 If you tried to cast spell 'z', you cast the identify spell (Lucas Ackerman);
 plus a few more which I forget right now.

1.02 (4/10/97)
A few more items and traps have been added;
The game now uses the rogue keys (hjklyubn) properly;
You used to be able to throw and zap straight when confused. No longer!

1.03 (4/10/97)
Some unique items were added;
A silly bug, by which your item knowledge was not saved, was fixed (Darren
Hebden);
Teleport traps now work properly;
I think I fixed another bug, but I can't remember.

1.04 (6/10/97)
A few really nasty bugs with saved games were fixed. The game would not save
 enchantments affecting monsters, and would mess up the items carried by the
 monsters (Adam Horowitz);
A bug with the enchanting/corroding of shields was fixed;
A '<=' instead of a '<' led to characters not using shields occasionally
 blocking trap missiles (Adam Horowitz);
You can now type '+' or '-' in the map screen to move around faster (Adam
 Horowitz);
The direction function now accepts '.' as well as delete (Adam Horowitz);
During your first step while long-walking, you can walk on anything (still
 prompts for water etc, though) (Adam Horowitz);
I think that was all.

1.05 (7/10/97)
A minor display bug was fixed;
A bug with restoring clouds from saved games was fixed;
A major bug which caused a segment violation when restoring saved games if
 there were any magical traps on the level was finally discovered and fixed.
Those pathetic worms you see around level 6 are now nastier, and jackals now
 tend to appear in packs.
This time, your item memory really does work.

1.1 (14/10/97)
Several new items and monsters were added;
Labyrinths were added;
Magical weapons are now less powerful;
Some bugs have been fixed - I forget what they were right now;
The source was released, and Crawl is now under the GPL (see Licence.txt for
 details);

1.2 (2/10/97)
The monster and cloud location bits have been completely rewritten, a process
 which turned out to be rather easier than I thought it would be. The new
 system is much more flexible;
Monsters are now a bit more intelligent, especially in the way they treat
 clouds;
Several monsters have been added;
Several items and two new classes of items (Carrion and Miscellaneous) have
 been added;
Several spells, most of them necromantic, have been added;
The Gladiator, Necromancer, and Paladin classes have been added;
A spell type system has been implemented, and several new staves to specialise
 in particular types of magic have been added (conjuration, summoning etc).
New unique items have been added, and a bug (actually, a mistype) which
 prevented some from being generated has been removed;
A few bugs have been removed;
Several other changes have been made, too numerous to mention here.

2.0 (9/12/97)
There have been so many additions in this version that I'm not going to list
 them all, but here is a very incomplete list of bugs and things rectified:
Characters could cause an excessive amount of damage empty-handed (Bridget
 Farace);
Darts didn't fire properly when character not wielding anything (Bridget
 Farace);
Hand crossbows didn't work properly;
Fireballs always did the same amount of damage (0-27), regardless of who cast
 them and how powerful they were;
Going to Hell could have unexpected results due to an out-of-bounds reference
 to levels_exist [].

2.01 (12/12/97)
I had wanted version 2.0 to be a stable and bug-less release, but this was not
to be. Anyway, 2.01 fixes these bugs:
Zapping a wand of polymorph at yourself caused problems (polymorph self hasn't
 been implemented anyway) (Saradon);
Polymorph other didn't work properly;
Choosing a non-existent item in a shop crashed the game (but only sometimes,
 which was why I didn't notice it) (Saradon);
Spell descriptions weren't working properly (Saradon);
Some messages were misspelt due to an indiscriminate search/replace (Adam
 Horowitz);
Detect curse didn't detect curses on unrecognised rings (this bug had
 been present right from version 1.0);
Sometimes, a special weapon in the hands of a monster would not function
 properly (watch out for creatures wielding weapons of draining!);
The use of the control key was not mentioned in the command list (it
 opens/closes doors, like in Angband);
And a few others (if I haven't credited someone, please tell me).
Also, a few new things were added, as suggested by Saradon: A shout command
('!') to attract your followers (and enemies!), and better equipment for the
enchanter. Also, you are now given a difficulty message and prompted when
memorising spells, so you will know which spells you won't be able to cast
reliably before you memorise them.

2.02 (13/12/97)
I'm afraid that 2.01 didn't fully fix the bug in the shop code, but hopefully
this version does. Just about the only differences between this version and
2.01 are:
Pressing r,s or t while in a shop really no longer crashes the game (Saradon &
 Bridget Farace);
If the Scores file is not present, a new one is generated. I've stopped
 including a scores file in the distribution, so that you can unpack the zip
 file into your old crawl directory and keep on using the old score file.
Save games should be compatible with 2.01.

2.03 (22/12/97)
This version fixes a few bugs, and puts back the floating point emulation
which was missing from previous version 2 releases (Daniel Josef Dekok and
someone else noticed this). It also removes the debugging code which was
accidentally included.
Bugs fixed:
Butterfly corpses were coloured black, making them invisible (Bridget
 Farace);
Shadow lanterns were also coloured black, and kept on working even after you
 unwielded them (Bridget Farace);
Items purchased from shops were not identified properly (Lord Gek, Timo
 Laitila);
Scrolls of acquirement weren't being identified after being read;
When you got hit by a monster wielding a weapon of draining, events could
 become confusing (Timo Laitila);
Finally, the '5' key on the keypad works as a rest key (Timo Laitila);
Names longer than 8 letters caused problems with saving and restoring games,
 especially in Windows 95 (Lord Gek & Timo Laitila)

The following new features were also added:
When tame creatures kill monsters, you now get 1/3 xp (Howard Liu);
Orcish spellcasters have been downgraded a bit (lots of people recommended
 this);
Specialist wizards are now slightly more powerful in their specialisation,
 especially with magical staves (I can't find the usenet post which told me
 about this).
And a few other minor changes.

2.10 (30/12/97)
Sorry to all of the many people who've been sending me bug reports, but it's
become too tricky to list all bugs and credit their finder. I'm just getting
too much email, and my mail reader has a strange way of eating some messages
and making them very difficult to find. So from now on, I'll just list some of
the major bugs fixed and major features added:
-A bug with wearing armour of fire/cold resistance was fixed;
-The properties of several items and spells were tweaked a bit;
-Specialist wizards were made even more powerful in their discipline;
-The dungeon was made deeper (36 levels now), and lots of new monsters were
added to fill in the deeper levels;
-Several spells (mostly necromancy) were added;
-The dungeon architecture is a bit more varied, especially as you get deeper;
-A warning was added to labyrinths;
among other things.

2.11 - This was the first Linux release, ported to Linux by Svante Gerhard.

classes. Heaps of spells, items and monsters added (as usual).

2.51 (18/5/98) - Purely a bug-fix version:

     parts of it have, anyway);

 - A couple of bugs in monster teleportation have been fixed.

2.60 (1/9/98) - The Source Code Clean-up is finally finished!
 - Functions have been split up into about 30 different modules, making coding
    *much* easier.
 - All functions are now available from any module.
 - An alternative display set for non-IBM graphics displays included (activate
    it with a -c command-line switch).
 - Several minor balancing changes were made.
 - If the game crashes, you can continue from the last save (unless it crashed
    during saving). Your game is autosaved every time you climb stairs.
 - A great number of interface changes were made, many of which were suggested
    by Eino Keskitalo and Jim Baranovich. These include:
     +The clumsy '^' untrap command has been replaced by a new use for the
       control key;
     +The character selection menus have been streamlined, with a new random
       option;
     +Shop displays are easier to read;
     +The old message display has been rendered readable;
     +It is now possible to reorder items and spells;
     +And various other things.

  * This is the last version which I (LH) will be releasing in the near
future. I'm moving out of home to student accomodation near Adelaide Uni and I
won't have my mother's computer to play with any more (Note change of email
address: it's now linley.henzell@student.adelaide.edu.au). But hopefully Crawl
will continue to be actively developed by others on the internet. Happy
Crawling!
