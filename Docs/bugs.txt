Bugs:

* pressing ctrl-4 in Linux can cause a core dump

* Monsters can be created on top of doors.

* makefile for sgi IRIX does not work.  No clue why.

* Sometimes when I'm in the Abyss and I use an exit, it goes into an
  infinite loop.  This is hard to replicate, though.

* DJGPP (dos compiler) may puke up a lung on some of the very long functions
  if you try to compile using certain options.  Sometimes simply running make
  again will work, sometimes you will have to change the options.

* values 250 - 310 should be reserved for Uniques in the monsters enum,
  but 260 - 280 are occupied by other monsters.  Should move them if it
  won't mess anything else up.  If they are moved, remember to alter the
  ouch.cc check to see if 'a' is put in front of the unique's name in the
  scores.

* Various odd effects when playing in term on Linux.  May be terminfo's fault.

*  "-5 stone" is heavily enchanted to do *more* damage and costs 100

*  "+6" was missile weapon generated in a jewellery shop

*  targeting is off at times (possible rounding errors)

*  fired beams sometimes take the wrong route and can't hit targets in los

*  killed by program bug when killed by exploding spore

*  fix keypad... still broken

*  Skeletal Warrior cast a spell and seg faulted the game in the abyss.

* Makleb's Minor Destruction (first prompt '8' crashes game under DOS?)

* From the code it appears that dropping items takes zero time...

* Currently possible to gain 0hp when gaining a level... should
  be safeguards added to make sure this is at least never negative,
  if not guaranteeing 1hp / level.

* If you have teleport control you'll see a prompt that says, "You may
choose your destination (press '.' or delete to select)". I somehow got
into the habit of immediately blowing by this prompt without ever reading
it so I was always flailing around whenever I tried to teleport. I've
changed show_map() so that it accepts '\r' as well as '.' which should be
much more intuitive, but I don't see a check for the delete key in
show_map() so I think the prompt is wrong.

* Armour skill advances too slowly?

        Maybe another solution would be to bump up the base AC values of
        each armour type. I only used the T$R standard values as a kind
        of default; I see no reason why plate mail should give 7 points
        instead of 12 or 15 (especially as the base AC of body armour
        is usually inconsequential compared to the protection offered
        by a set of magical gloves, boots, a cloak etc).

* Teleport control is really wacky. I'd expect to be able to use the
return key to select the square but it seems to key off one of the
keypad keys.

* Hunger status isn't redrawn when change level (definitely happens with
engorged and I think with full as well).
    -- should be fixed now (bwross)
    -- it's not fixed (JDJ)

* An item is cursed if its "iplus" value is "big enough".  However, "big
enough" is >80 in some places, >130 in others, and perhaps >120 in others.
I'm not sure about the 120 -- I recall seeing it but can't find it now.

Right now a have an artifact ring that I can't uncurse since the value
used is when uncursing is 130, and the value used when sticking is 80.
The uncursing code checks against 80 for one hand, and against 130 for
the other.

* Artifact weapons of Holy Wrath can be wielded by undead.

* Line of sight code seems flaky: fairly often bits of the dungeon
become visible even though they're in an unconnected part of the map.

* Cloaks of poison resistance don't work. It looks like I added
this new type of cloak without also adding a check in the
player_res_poison function in player.cc. This should be easy to
fix.

* I found "an amulet of Cekugob". This is an "unrandart" and
should be identified as "the amulet of Cekugob". Also, a 'V'
check indicated none of its powers, but at least some of them
were being applied to my char. I don't know exactly what's
going on here, but I'll check the next time I'm at my
parents' house.

* Sometimes when I target a spell like fireball, I can target a
square that I can't see, and other times I can't.

* I have had monsters shout upon seeing me, when I couldn't see them.

* When ascending stairs, there are three unlit squares in each quadrant
that will light after waiting a turn.

* beams aren't always visible
    -- should be fixed (at least for curses) (bwross)

* Screen isn't always updated when wielded object changes?
    -- hopefully fixed most of these (bwross)

* Fix the inventory count bug.  The inventory counter occasionally
  gets out of sync, it should either be moved or fixed.

* Check things for screen length problems, and fix them... ie. map centering
  is still off base line 12, should this be shifted for longer windows?

* Is food caching fix correct... food seems to disappear quickly, rather
   than rot away
    -- it doesn't seem quite right: food will sometimes rot, but more often
    it seems to disappear too quickly (JDJ)

* Entering Ecumenical Temple may cause game to crash?

* Missing space when printing gold amounts?

* Full inventory doesn't account for the possibility of items stacking or
  for picking up gold.

* Conjure flame should do damage at a constant rate, not when creatures
  in it move.

* Friendly creatures become hostile... may occur when player loses
  invisibility while the creature is in view.

* Teleport/Blink + Control is too powerful -- especially for vaults

* EV seems to get screwed up after transforms, it seems to get
   at the transform value when the player has no armour (calculated
   correctly once armour is on).

* Using stairs/portals sometimes misplaces the player (either into
  solid rock, or onto bogus levels (level 28 of the dungeon, level
  -1 of a sub-dungeon).

* The fact that ghost can't follow the player up stairs is a problem.
  Suggested solution is to teleport the ghost away and heal it.

* Giant spores should affect food on ground as well as in inventory
