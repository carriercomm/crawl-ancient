Notes for building crawl with VACPP
-----------------------------------
* when including source,  make sure source type is
  defined to be 'cpp'  - VACPP doesn't know how to
  handle .cc extensions.
* include libw32c.cc as a source object;
  ignore the other lib*.cc files
* define the macro WIN32CONSOLE
* MUST build with signedchars = yes

Other than this,  it's pretty straightforward.
