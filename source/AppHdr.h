 *  File:       AppHdr.h
 *  Summary:    Precompiled header used by Crawl.
 *  Written by: Jesse Jones
 *
 * Abstract: CodeWarrior and MSVC both support precompiled headers which can
 *      significantly speed up compiles. Unlike CodeWarrior MSVC imposes
 *      some annoying restrictions on precompiled headers: the precompiled
 *      header *must* be the first include in all cc files. Any includes or
 *      other statements that occur before the pch include are ignored. This
 *      is really stupid and can lead to bizarre errors, but it does mean
 *      that we shouldn't run into any problems on systems without precompiled
 *      headers.

 *  Change History (most recent first):
 *
 *       <9>    9 Aug 2001   MV     Added USE_RIVERS,USE_NEW_UNRANDS
 *                                  and MISSILE_TRAILS_OFF #define
 *       <8>   10 May 2001  GDL     Added FreeBSD support
 *                                  courtesy Andrew E. Filonov
 *       <7>    9 May 2000  GDL     Added Windows 32 bit console support
 *       <6>    24mar2000   jmf     Added a whole slew of new options, which
 *                                  ought to be mandatory :-)
 *       <5>     10/12/99   BCR     Added USE_NEW_RANDOM #define
 *       <4>     9/25/99    CDL     linuxlib -> liblinux
 *       <3>     6/18/99    BCR     Moved the CHARACTER_SET #define here from
 *                                  linuxlib.cc.  Also wrapped the #define
 *                                  USE_MACROS to prevent it from being used by
 *                                  Linux.
 *       <2>     6/17/99    BCR     Removed 'linux' check, replaced it with
 *                                  'LINUX' check.  Now need to be -DLINUX
 *                                  during compile.  Also moved
 *                                  CHARACTER_SET #define here from
 *                                  linuxlib.cc
 *       <1>     5/30/99    JDJ     Created (from config.h)
