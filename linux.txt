Some notes about the Linux port of Dungeon Crawl:

Numpad won't work for normal walking. Linux specific code will have to
be written to handle the different escape codes. Use vi-like movement for
now:

            y k u
             \|/
            h-O-l
             /|\
            b j n

To compile source I recommend the following versions or later:
g++ 2.7.2.3      (2.7.0 might get confused, haven't tried others)
ncurses 1.9.9e   (1.9.9g also tested sucessfully)
libc5.4.33       (glibc2 also tested sucessfully)

Very little testing has been done so far, so please report bugs to:
Svante Gerhard <svante@algonet.se>       (Linux specific problems)
Linley Henzell <zel@olis.net.au>         (General Q's, and perhaps a CC:)

Thanks to Fredrik Estreen for letting me rave on his machine when testing
the crawl port!


[from the 2.10 linux.txt]
Porting to other unixes:

Just for fun, I tried to compile the game on a machine like this:
SunOS kairos 5.5.1 Generic_103640-14 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
This is one of the servers that my ISP uses.
With very minor modifications, I got it to compile.

Then I tried the game and it seemed to run great. Of course, I got no fancy
high ascii since I was running over a modemline with vt100 emulation, so
I can't say I really tried it out, but porting should be trivial.

All of my work is donated to Linley Henzell, and thus follows whatever
licensing he chooses for his game.

history:
--------

2.10 beta 1-3: Internal testing. Only partly working, never released.

2.10 beta   4: First version released to public. Feedback wanted.

2.20 Since no serious bug reports were received from the 2.10 release
     this port has now left beta stage. 2.20 was never released however
     since Linley had some problems with bugs. They should be fixed now
     however in...

2.21 All the new features of the DOS 2.21 release. No real LINUX specific
     news however. This version handed over to Linley on Feb 21 1998.

2.30 - 2.32 : Never released for various reasons, mainly due to known bugs
     found in the DOS version. Also, some version had trouble compiling.

2.33 MAJOR code cleanup, mainly by Linley of course. However, also the
     linuxlib had some minor tweaking now when all the warnings are gone.
     (Made my own mistakes stand out :) )
     Also, I noticed Ctrl-j now works for open-door-south. Linley, what did
     you do? ;)
