# Crawl Init file
#
# Lines begining with '#' are comments.  The basic syntax is:
#
# field = value         or      field.subfield = value
#
# Only one specification is allowed per line.
#
# The terms are typically case-insensitive except in the fairly obvious
# cases (the character's name and specifying files or directories when
# on a system that has case-sensitive filenames).
#
# White space is stripped from the begining and end of the line, as
# well as imediately before and after the '='.  All other whitespace
# is left alone.

# The weapon option allows defaulting on the weapon selection screen

# Macro colours to other colours

# Useful for terminals where some colours are hards to read (and cannot

# background.
#
# Format is colour.OLDCOLOUR = NEWCOLOUR, later rules take preference and
# the NEWCOLOUR is always literal (ie. it won't re-evaluate to a different

#
# The colours are:
#
# black, blue, green, cyan, red, magenta, brown, lightgrey, darkgrey,

# Message channel options:
#
# Format is channel.CHANNEL_NAME = (COLOUR|mute|default|on|off|plain)
#
# CHANNEL_NAME can currently be one of these:
#   plain           = regular text (and things "uncoloured")
#   prompt          = input prompts to the player
#   god             = messages from the gods
#   duration        = messages about character spells/effects wearing off
#   danger          = serious threats to the characters existence
#   food            = warnings about food
#   warning         = various other warnings
#   recovery        = recovery from disease/stat loss/poison conditions
#   talk            = monsters talking (acting)
#   intrinsic_gain  = level/stat/species power gains
#   mutation        = gain/lose mutations
#   monster_spell   = messages about monsters gesturing and casting spells
#   monster_enchant = messages pertaining to monster enchantments (up or down)
#   monster_damage  = messages telling how damaged a monster is
#
# COLOUR can be any of the colours in the colour section above.
#
# Other channel options:
#
#   mute    = show no messages from channel (dangerous, be careful!)
#   default = turn channel on to it's default "colourful" scheme
#   on      = same as default
#   plain   = make channel the same colour as the "plain" channel
#             (won't do anything silly like "mute" if plain == mute, though)
#   off     = same as plain
#
# Note: The only multi-colour channels currently are monster_damage and
#       god.  Setting god to a COLOUR will make all god messages that
#       colour.  Setting monster_damage to a colour will make the
#       "monster dies" messages that colour, and the "injured" messages
#       will be plain coloured.  More control of these and other channels
#       will be coming later.
#

# channel.plain = green
# channel.god = default
# channel.talk = mute
# channel.warning = plain

#
# hp_warning gives "* * * LOW HITPOINT WARNING * * *" on the danger channel
# when the player takens damage and their hitpoints are less than this
# percentage of their maximum (use 0 to turn off these messages).
